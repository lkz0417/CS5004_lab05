(1) If AbstractShape.java exists, we can only modify the compareTo method in the abstract class
AbstractShape.java, change the logic of comparison.

(2) If AbstractShape.java doesn't exist, we need to modify the compareTo method ,change the logic
 of comparison in every concrete class(rectangle, triangle, circle) and make them implements the
 Comparable interface.
